            It isn’t often that a college student genuinely enjoys their university-mandated general education classes, but the fall 2014 session of Meteorology 101 located in Davidson 110 was an exception for these two. They both went into it because their friends had told them it was an easy A, and didn’t expect it to turn into the beginning of a new chapter in both of their lives.

            Drew sat behind Julie during every class, and eventually they became pretty good friends. Drew had bought himself a blueberry muffin for breakfast from the small kiosk outside the classroom every Tuesday and Thursday (from the famous Davidson lady), and started buying Julie a muffin as well. At the end of the semester, Julie offered up her phone number through Facebook, saying “If you just have to have my number, here it is!”

            They didn’t talk much over that winter break, but as fate would have it, Julie and Drew walked into the same History class for the spring 2015 semester -- they had unknowingly registered for yet another gen-ed session together. Their friendship was already great, but now they had another semester to get even closer. They would go on to spend evenings together studying for a particularly challenging History class, buy each other candy bars when the other had a particularly bad day, and surprise one another with unexpected gifts for their birthday.

            Drew finally asked Julie out on a date on March 27th, 2015. He surprised her with dinner at her favorite restaurant Logan’s Roadhouse, dessert at her favorite ice cream place Graeters, and a movie afterwards. Fate struck once again and Julie’s father just happened to be dining with friends at a restaurant down the street, and she insisted that Drew go to meet him that evening. Her father’s approval after the night of the first date sealed the deal -- Julie and Drew were in it for the long haul.

            Three years of college stresses together made their bond stronger than ever before, and on March 24th, 2018, Drew sent Julie along with several of her closest friends on a recreation of their first date and to relive their journey together -- lunch at Logan’s followed by a trip to the movie theater, the house they lived in together, Drew’s old apartment where many nights were spent laughing and enjoying each other’s company, and eventually right back to Davidson 110. Here, where they originally met, in front of her family and friends, Drew asked Julie to be his wife.

            It turns out that if you give a girl a muffin, she’ll eventually want a husband to go along with it too. Now, they are excited to begin the next chapter of their lives together by celebrating their marriage on June 30th, 2019 at The Olmsted.
